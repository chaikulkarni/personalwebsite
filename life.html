            <p>It's been 10 years since I got introduced to the world of craft beer. </br>
            The passion involved so much that at the age of 23, I started a craft beer brand with my childhood friend. </p>
            
            </br>

            <p>The passion has continued and the love still persists. </p>
            <p>During my free time, I either brew or visit breweries. </p>
            
            </br>
                    
            <h1>Coffee</h1>
            
            </br>
            
            <p>I am a big coffee fiend. For those with similar interest, my current setup is a Niche Zero and Rancilio Siliva V6. </p>
            
            </br>
            
            <p>Recent favourite roasteries include Monsoon Estate (UK), DAK (Netherlands), Subko (India) </p> 
            
            </br>
            
            <p>
                Plan to add a PID soon.
